Description: This package contains the functions used for importing bigWig files, feature specification, matrix generation, and output plotting within the seqEasy application
    importBWlist - imports bigWig files and assigns names specified by the user to the imported objects. It also allows for selection of only a portion of the bigwig file to be imported when specified by a region GRanges object
    matList - generates matrices using the normaliseToMatrix function from a list of bigWig files and a list of region file GRanges objects with a selection of arguments to customise the matrices generated
    hmList - generates heatmaps using the EnrichedHeatmap function from a list of matrices and a vector specifying windows. There are a range of customisation options available that the user can apply to their heatmaps
    mplot - creates average profile plots using the ggplot function from a list of matrices. There are a wide variety of arguments which can be customised to improve the output.
    getFeature - adapted from the rootGenomics library with a few alterations. The function allows specification of specific region blocks from a GRanges object such as flank regions and exon information
